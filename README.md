# Pomodoro-Timer
<p>A Pomodoro timer is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It typically runs for 25-minute work intervals, followed by short breaks. This method aims to enhance focus and combat procrastination. Users work intensively during the "Pomodoro" period, then take a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is recommended.</p>
